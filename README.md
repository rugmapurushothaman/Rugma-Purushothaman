**About Me**

I am a Cyber Forensics Analyst with hands-on experience in digital evidence acquisition, phishing investigation, IOC analysis, and forensic reporting. I previously worked as an Assistant Professor, where I combined academic rigor with real-world cyber forensic practices through labs, simulations, and student mentoring. My interests lie in digital forensics, forensic analysis of systems and data, and methodical evidence examination, with a strong focus on documentation standards, technical accuracy, and continuous learning.
